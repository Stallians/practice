'The takeaway is that you should not be using smaller networks because you are afraid of overfitting. Instead, you should use as big of a neural network as your computational budget allows, and use other regularization techniques to control overfitting'

'More layers, less number of nodes'

Intuition Behind Residual Networks:

1.  if the extra layers added to the deeper network are identity mappings, they become equivalent to the shallower network.
2.
